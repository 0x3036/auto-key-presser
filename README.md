# auto-key-presser
Auto Key Presser is a simple C# .NET program I wrote that uses SendKeys to simulate keystroke/s or mouse presses at a settable interval.

It also features the ability to add a random amount of milliseconds to the interval to simulate the key press at slightly different times every time â€“ thus bypassing basic anti-bot detection.

The timer can also be turned on/off via a global hotkey combination (Control + O) for use in games and other applications without having to tab out.
